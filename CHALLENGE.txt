ProperView – Real Estate Listing & Management Platform Coding
Challenge
Overview
You're building ProperView, a real estate listing and management platform used by agents to:
- Add and manage property listings
- Track inquiries from potential buyers
- View basic analytics on listing performance
This challenge is designed to assess your ability to design and implement a full stack
application using modern technologies, for example React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript.
Your solution should emphasize clean architecture, maintainability, and a professional-grade
developer experience.
Utilizing an AI powered IDE is optional but preferred.
Requirements
